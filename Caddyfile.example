# Example Caddy config for HTTPS + reverse proxy
#
# 1) Replace "yourdomain.com" with your real domain.
# 2) Run the app locally (recommended):
#      WEB_HOST=127.0.0.1 WEB_PORT=8892 ./start_web_server_prod.sh
# 3) Run caddy:
#      caddy run --config ./Caddyfile

# Notes:
# - You must forward ports 80 and 443 from your router to this machine.
# - Your domain's DNS A record must point to your public IP.
